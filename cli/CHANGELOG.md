## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **`skills upgrade`** command — check for and install CLI updates. Supports `--check` flag for dry-run. Auto-detects package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun) and runner (npx, pnpm dlx, bunx, yarn dlx).
- **`skills lock`** command group — manage `skills.lock` file for version pinning:
  - `skills lock create` — generate lock file from currently installed skills
  - `skills lock show` — display locked skill versions
  - `skills lock update [names...]` — update lock entries to latest commit
  - `skills lock remove <names...>` — remove skills from lock file
- **`skills.lock` file** — pin skills to specific Git commit hashes for reproducible installations
- **`--lock` flag** on `skills install` — write/update `skills.lock` after installation
- **`--frozen` flag** on `skills install` — install using exact versions from `skills.lock` (CI-friendly)
- `release` script in package.json for automated version bumping, committing, and tagging
- CHANGELOG.md for tracking release history
